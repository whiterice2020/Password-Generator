# Password-Generator
Password Generator Project 3
This webpage will generate a random password based on the users choices

Promts and alerts will be utilized
First prompt will ask the user how many chars to use for the pw

If the answer is outside the allowed field it will not allow them to continue and send an alert telling them the error

Prompts after that will ask which type of characters to use, each character selection using a seperate prompt

Their answers will be thrown into an if a var which then will be used in an if statement

arrays will be built and concat into a string, the math.random will pull random characters

then finally output back to the html page inside the box
